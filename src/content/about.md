# About this website

This website is a **fully functional markdown editor**, that serves a dual purpose as my **personal portfolio** and blog platform. Any edits made by you on this website are fully local and not persisted [*yet*](https://github.com/injaneity/injaneity/issues/3), so feel free to mess around!

> Hint: Type `rant` in the search bar to find what I write.

### How did you create this?

The editor functionality is built with [**Tiptap Editor**](https://tiptap.dev/), with custom handling to match my personal design principles. Much of the styling and colour scheme was taken from [**CloudFlare**](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/), and almost built entirely (with guidance) by [**Claude Code**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code).

### How do I contribute?

Feel free to open an issue or pull request on [**Github**](https://github.com/injaneity/injaneity).
