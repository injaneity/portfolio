Welcome to my portfolio! Even though it may be more accurate to call it a markdown editor that happens to have my profile information in it. This is my (slightly) opinionated take on a markdown editor (with some bells and whistles) built on top of the Tiptap editor (shoutout to Substack & Notion), inspired by these (personal) design principles:

- No buttons, only shortcuts (therefore no action bar)
- No distinction between editing and viewing mode
- Platform & application agnostic formatting

### Contributions

Feel free to open an issue / feature request. For feature requests, please ensure that it aligns with the design principles mentioned above. For more complicated functionality, expect to not see them, or see them as easter eggs (who knows?). I plan to create an editing experience more joyful than other commercial editors such as Obsidian or Notion -- so see this as a testing ground.
